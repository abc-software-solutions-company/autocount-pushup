# Feature Specification: Push-Up Auto-Counter Webapp

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a webapp for auto-counting my push up"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A fitness enthusiast wants to track their push-up workouts without manually counting repetitions. They open the webapp on their mobile device, start a workout session, and perform push-ups while the app automatically detects and counts each repetition using their device's camera or sensors. After completing their workout, they can view their count, save the session, and track their progress over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the webapp, **When** they tap "Start Workout", **Then** the counting interface activates and displays "0 push-ups"
2. **Given** the counting is active, **When** the user performs a complete push-up motion, **Then** the counter increments by 1 and provides visual/audio feedback
3. **Given** the user completes their workout, **When** they tap "Stop", **Then** the session is saved with timestamp, count, and duration
4. **Given** the user has completed previous workouts, **When** they view their history, **Then** they can see past sessions with dates, counts, and progress trends

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the detection system fails to recognize a push-up (false negative)?
- What happens when the system incorrectly counts a movement as a push-up (false positive)?
- How does the system handle poor lighting conditions or camera obstruction?
- What happens if the user pauses mid-workout or accidentally closes the app?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically detect and count push-up repetitions in real-time
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback when a push-up is counted
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to start and stop workout sessions with clear controls
- **FR-004**: System MUST save workout sessions with count, duration, and timestamp
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view their workout history and progress over time
- **FR-006**: System MUST work on mobile devices with camera access [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific mobile platforms - iOS, Android, or both?]
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to manually adjust the count if detection is inaccurate
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide audio feedback for each counted push-up [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should audio be optional/configurable?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle workout interruptions gracefully (pause/resume functionality)
- **FR-010**: System MUST work in various lighting conditions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum lighting requirements?]

### Key Entities
- **Workout Session**: Represents a single push-up workout with start time, end time, total count, duration, and detection accuracy metrics
- **User Profile**: Stores user preferences, workout history, and progress statistics
- **Push-Up Event**: Individual push-up detection with timestamp and confidence score
- **Progress Statistics**: Aggregated data showing trends, personal records, and achievement milestones
