## Scenario 5: Accessibility Testing

### Steps:
1. **Navigate using only keyboard**
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Use spacebar to start/stop workouts
   - Use arrow keys for manual adjustments

2. **Test with screen reader** (if available)
   - Verify all buttons have proper labels
   - Check that count updates are announced
   - Confirm workout status is communicated

3. **Test high contrast mode**
   - Enable system high contrast
   - Verify all UI elements remain visible

- [ ] High contrast mode maintains usability
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible

## Scenario 6: Performance and Error Handling

### Steps:

   - **Expected**: Detection accuracy warning appears
   - **Expected**: Suggestion to improve lighting or use manual mode

2. **Cover camera during workout**
   - **Expected**: Detection pauses gracefully
   - **Expected**: Option to continue manually or fix camera

3. **Test with slow network** (throttle to 3G)
